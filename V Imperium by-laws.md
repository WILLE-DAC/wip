## General provisions

<p align="center">
<b>( article 1 )</b><br>
Mission
</p>

V Imperium is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) committed to developing and implementing software tools that promote democracy, call it liquid or digital. These tools make use of remote e-voting and strong identity management in order to be able to achieve on-line consensus. Our action takes place all over the world from developed countries to installed dictatorships; we are here to help humanity achieve its full potential by combating concentration of power and its abuse.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 2 )</b><br>
Name, acronym and symbol
</p>

This DAO is named V Imperium inspired by a popular anime series and which stands in German for volition or 'the' will. Colors are white and blue and as a symbol we have a lock and a key in representation of our strong values regarding cybersecurity.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3 )</b><br>
Recognition of the Model Law for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) by the Coalition of Automated Legal Applications
</p>

Considering that at the moment of publication, there is a legal vacuum as regards to how DAOs should be framed in the legal context, worldwide, V Imperium endorses the adoption of the Model Law for DAOs<sup>[1](https://www.lextechinstitute.ch/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DAO-Model-Law.pdf)</sup> written by the COALA organization.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 4 )</b><br>
On-line discussion platform
</p>

The on-line discussion platform, or on-line platform short, is computer software and the necessary underlying blockchain infrastructure that allows secure exchange of messages and the realization of cheap, fast and reliable on-line referendums between members of the DAO. It also provides the visualization of live video streams of video-conferences and debates and serves as a repository for data necessary to the study of the proposals put forward by DAO members.

I. All the information and tools that are considered important to the functioning of the V Imperium DAO are to be readily available for consultation with real-time data whenever possible on the on-line platform.

II. The on-line platform must deploy the most advanced technologies for identity management and secured communications. This includes cryptographic algorithms such as PKI, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Homomorphic Encryption, blockchain, etc., whenever necessary.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 4-b )</b><br>
Functionalities
</p>

Through the on-line platform the DAO members are able to:

I. Watch live streams of any debates and video-conferences that may take place during the DAO activities as well as provide access to previous debates at any time and at all levels of the organisation. This functionality can be paired with existing decentralized networks such as IPFS, Odysee or Skynet as examples.

II. DAO members can chat on-line, publish content and rate each others publications. This can be done publicly or in private groups.

III. Members may publish proposals and vote on-line remotely from their own computer in any location. The voting procedure as well as the final tally must be verifiable by the voter while guaranteeing privacy. This is accomplished through cryptography.<sup>[2](https://github.com/partidodigitalpt/documentation/blob/main/Remote%20e-voting%20overview.md)</sup>

IV. Members are able to delegate to other members the ability to vote on a specific proposal or on a category of proposals and retract the delegation at any time. Delegation is transitive unless stated otherwise.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 4-c )</b><br>
Discussion forum
</p>

The on-line platform has a specific view; an on-line bulletin board, also known as a forum, to be used for written discourse where:

I. Functionalities mentioned in the previous article 4-b I to IV can be linked to and accessed. Each proposal is automatically assigned a topic.

II. Topics are categorized according to different areas of interest.

III. Moderation is user-centric meaning no special roles are assigned to any user.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 5 )</b><br>
Registration
</p>

The enrolment in the DAO is an individual choice and requires the investment of a minimum sum in cryptocurrency and a passphrase given by one of V Imperium's members. Raw biometric data is never to be kept in any database.

I. Adherence to or withdrawal from the DAO is made exclusively through the on-line platform. Registries are published and managed in a decentralized database (blockchain).

<p align="center">
<b>( article 5-b )</b><br>
Anonymity
</p>

1. Stakeholders identity is conceiled; stakeholders can publish and vote on proposals, invest and withdraw cryptocurrency without disclosing real identity.

2. Angels need to proove their previous membership as angels within NERV sister DAO but need not disclose their real identity.

3. Composition and identity of KREDIT members must be dully disclosed.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 6 )</b><br>
Incompatibility regime
</p>

DAO members may hold no more than one position within the DAO official structures unless stated otherwise.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 7 )</b><br>
Rights and duties of DAO members
</p>

It is the right of members of the DAO to participate in all activities and bodies, to formulate any suggestion or criticism that may be deemed convenient or to publish new proposals or changes to existing ones. Everything should be doable with the support of the on-line platform. Alternatively, V Imperium welcomes paper-based proposals and referendums.

I. Decisions at all levels are to be made by democratic consensus.

II. Every member of the DAO has the right to elect and be elected to any of the DAO’s organs.

III. The right to be informed in a transparent and clear way about all economical activities of the DAO.

IV. Members are entitled free access to all documents ratified by DAO bodies that result from meetings, workings and  internal referendums held during the normal functioning of the DAO. The information must be available in digital format in the on-line platform.

V. It is duty to perform with zeal, assiduity and loyalty to the other members the positions, functions and workings entrusted by them.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 8 )</b><br>
Works
</p>

DAO members are invited to contribute to the elaboration, execution and supervision of a myriad of projects related to the mission of V Imperium. To be eligible, members must inform the DAO of the availability and area of expertise through the on-line platform.

I. By signing up as volunteers and depending on the academic background, members are able to execute tasks and perform jobs in representation of V Imperium which can be recompensated monetarily.

II. The adjudication, management and supervision of the works are of the responsibility of various ethical committees, or angels.

III. The acceptance of a job position within the DAO requires the signing of a contract, either digitaly or in paper, between V Imperium and the contributor. Because there is no legal standards around this practice, we recommend the adoption of an equivalent of the DAO Contributor Agreement<sup>[3](https://github.com/LarryFlorio/LegalForms/blob/main/DAO-Contributor-Agmt/DAO%20Contributor%20Agreement.md)</sup> published by Larry Florio that may seem appropriate.

IV. Conditions for eligibility for the execution tasks and jobs, sources of financing and the procedures for the payments are established in Chapter IV – Smart-contracts.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 9 )</b><br>
Withdrawal
</p>

Membership withdrawal can be done at any time without any prejudice and with immediate effect.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 10 )</b><br>
Penalties
</p>

By going against these by-laws to which members of the DAO agreed upon joining, V Imperium members may be alerted or have their membership retracted for a temporary period or, for repeated misbehaviour or inexcusable situations such as; attempt to attack the informatic system or publishing inappropriate content into the on-line platform, the membership status may be revoked permanently. The decision to expel a DAO member is made by democratic consensus on the on-line platform where every member is granted equal vote:

I. Not partaking in DAO's activities by voting directly or by delegating the right to vote for a period longer than 180 days.

II. By not respecting the deadlines and tasks that were entrusted by the DAO and accepted by the member, the membership may be revoked temporarily for a period of up to 1 year.

III. Publishing pornography, inciting to any kind of physical violence or any form of hate speech against minorities be it of ethnographical origin, attacking normal sexual orientation (hetero-homo-bi) or making false accusations against other members may be reason enough to be banned for a period longer than 1 year.

IV. It's considered sufficient reason to ban a member from the DAO if unjustified false information is uploaded to the on-line platform.

V. It’s the responsibility of the ethical committees (angels) to develop mechanisms that contribute to the evaluation of the situations described above and to publish alerts on the on-line platform whenever it may be considered appropriate to do so.

VI. In case of expulsion from V Imperium a minimum value equivalent to the initial cryptocurrency invested by the expeled member is returned to the same.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 11 )</b><br>

## Internal organization

<p align="center">
<b>( article 1 )</b><br>

## Deliberative criteria

<p align="center">
<b>( article 1 )</b><br>
Democraticity
</p>

All internal decision-making from the choice of members that participate in the V Imperium organs to the choice of proposals that are to be implemented must be based on democratic criteria, namely, being elected or approved by simple consensus or positional majority through direct voting and ranked with a reputation metric. These algorithms are transparent in the sense that they run on smart-contracts on the blockchain.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 2 )</b><br>
Events
</p>

The announcement of the venue and the sending of invitations for the participation on all V Imperium’s activities is done automatically by the on-line platform with extra contacts to be made by mail and e-mail (from the V Imperium’s head office official addresses to the member’s official contacts whenever possible).

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3 )</b><br>
Proposals
</p>

Any DAO member can publish a new proposal or propose changes to existing proposals by using the forums on the on-line platform. The proposals must consist of a title, an abstract and a body:

I. The title must be a short phrase associated with the proposal with a maximum of 30 words.

II. The abstract should also briefly explain the subject to which it refers, and consist of between 100 and 300 words.

III. The body, without limitations, must contain the proposal itself as detailed as possible with the appropriate legal terms preferably. Attached to it may be added documents, images, PDF files, etc., other file formats that convey fundamental information to the understanding and elaboration of the proposal at hand.

IV. 30% of the treasury is to be reserved to quadratic funding rounds approved exclusively by angels and KREDIT but which can be vetoed by shareholders.

V. 70% of the treasury is to be governed by democratic consensus between all members of the DAO with each vote weighting proportionally to the stake.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3-b )</b><br>
Urgency
</p>

Parallel to the indicator defined above, DAO members are invited to classify a given policy according to how urgent they consider it to be; irrelevant, of little importance, useful, important and urgent.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3-c )</b><br>
Impact
</p>

I. Low impact proposals are those whose financing doesn’t exceed 1/1000000?th of the V Imperium's treasury and are prioritized up to of little importance.

II. Ordinary proposals are those whose financing is lower than 1/100000?th of the V Imperium's treasury or that are considered from useful or impactful.

III. Medium-impact proposals are those whose financing costs are greater than 1/10000?th of the V Imperium's treasury and whose priority is considered useful or impactful.

IV. High-impact proposals are considered to be all whose financing is greater than 1/1000?th of the V Imperium's treasury or whose priority is considered urgent.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3-d )</b><br>
Evaluation period
</p>

The proposal evaluation period is an evaluation period of 3 months during which the proposals are to be discussed amongst the DAO members and the various bodies before being officially accepted and implemented through smart-contracts.

I. The KREDIT may, by simple consensus, shorten the evaluation time for a given bill to a period no shorter than 1 month, if it is considered necessary to make urgent decisions. 

II. Analogously to the previous point, the evaluation period of a proposal can be extended to a maximum of 1 year by the KREDIT with simple majority consensus if it consideres necessary a more thorough study of the socio-economic impacts of the policy proposal or the capacity to execute accordingly is in question.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 4 )</b><br>
Veto</p>

As stipulated before:

I. Angels can veto proposals by shareholders.

II. Shareholders can veto quadratic funding rounds held by angels and KREDIT.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 5 )</b><br>
Negative adaptive quorum biasing
</p>

"A referendum can be either simple majority-carries in which 50%+1 of the votes decide the outcome or adaptive quorum biased. Adaptive quorum biasing makes the threshold for passing or rejecting a referendum higher or lower depending on how the referendum was originally proposed. Negative turnout bias makes a referendum require a super-majority to reject that decreases as turnout increases. Another way to think about the quorum biasing is that positive bias referendums will be rejected by default and negative bias referendums get passed by default."

<p align="center">
<b>( article 6 )</b><br>
Quadratic funding
</p>

(elaborate)

## Smart-contracts

<p align="center">
<b>( article 1 )</b><br>
Transparency
</p>

The V Imperium DAO has in its genesis the principle of transparency, that is, all decision-making, meetings, debates and internal procedures are always public.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 2 )</b><br>
Financing
</p>

Financing of the activities of the V Imperium is made by:

I. Voluntary contributions made in cryptocurrency by anyone to a wallet address.

II. Shareholders must transfer a minimum and a maximum value of cryptocurrency in order to aquire full membership.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 2-b )</b><br>
Contributions
</p>

Membership and participation in the V Imperium’s bodies is always free of additional charges only requiring the payment of the membership fee. However, DAO members are welcomed to give contributions by sending cryptocurrency to the V Imperium DAO’s wallet address. These contributions are to be publicly announced on the DAO’s official website and a special badge is given under the forum’s avatar of the donator in the on-line platform for a period.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3 )</b><br>
Cryptocurrency
</p>

The cryptocurrency that is to be used by the DAO is eth, the native cryptocurrency supported by Ethereum 2’s main-net.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 4 )</b><br>
Financial report
</p>

Because V Imperium runs on a dApp supported by blockchain financial reporting and accounting can be done automatically by a computer algorithm. In fact every proposal and transfer of money from V Imperium's treasury is properly recorded and accounted for. Thus we require a monthly publication on the official website of DAO and through the on-line platform:

I. A monthly provisional trial balance published at the beggining of each month.

II. A real trial balance published at the end of each month.

III. An annual financial report. (elaborate)

<p align="center">
<b>( article 5 )</b><br>
Global constraints
</p>

In order to prevent whale takeover a maximum budget of $10 000 per proposal and $100 000 per funding round (once a month) is imposed.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 6 )</b><br>
Dividends</p>

I. 1% of the total of the generated dividends at the end of the fiscal year are given and shared equally between KREDIT members.

II. At the end of each fiscal year, a % of the sum of the dividends generated by the DAO return to the investors in proportion to their stake.
